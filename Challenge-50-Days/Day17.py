Challenge #17:

Day 17: User Name Generator

Write a function called user_name, that creates a username for the user. The function should ask a user to input their name.
The function should then reverse the name and attach a randomly issued number between 0 â€“ 9 at the end of the name.
The function should return the username.


Extra Challenge: Sort by Length

names = [ "Peter", "Jon", "Andrew"]
Write a function called sort_length that takes a list of strings as an argument, and sorts the strings in ascending order according to their length. 
For example, the list above should return:
['Jon', 'Peter', 'Andrew']
Do not use the built-in sort functions
